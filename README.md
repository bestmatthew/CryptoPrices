Exploratory Data Analysis around BTC and other cryptocurrencies

# Introduction

Cryptocurrency, a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange, is far from a new concept. In 1983 eCash was a published and established concept: eCash software on a user's machine could store digital money which was cryptographically signed by a bank. The user could then spend the digital money at an accepting vendor without having to open any vendor accounts or sharing any payment information like credit card numbers. By 1990 eCash was 'off-line' ... meaning payees no longer had to contact a third party (i.e, The Bank). Exactly one (1) U.S. Bank accepted eCash as a micropayment system, before scrapping it completely a few years later, when it was picked up by Credit  Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Bank Austria, and others until eCash went bankrupt in 1998, unable to compete with credit cards.

When Bitcoin was released over a decade later in 2009, it was the world's first decentralized crypocurrency -- lacking an organizational or authoritative controlling body -- and put simply, an asset which may only be accessed by its key-holder.

The history lesson ends here, however. We will be examining price data from Bitcoin/BTC (2009) along with a few others that emerged years afterwards: Litecoin/LTC (2011, Ripple/XRP (2013), Monero/XMR (2014), and Etherium/ETH (2015). To state the obvious, this is in no way a *comparison* across these cryptocurrencies. Their only similarities, for the purposes of this exercise, is that they're digital assets that have a fluctuating USD value. 

We will examine the indivudal price data as well as look for correlations beween the coins and other yardsticks as well.


# The Data

Because most crypocurrencies are bound to a blockchain - a public ledger of records - 


- I used this cleaned dataset from XYZ which gave me this:

- First we loaded the data into pandas df

- Then we derived some more data from the given CSV and wrote some scripts to aggregate off ths new data

- Then we charted that shit - not super useful but if I had to bet, I could use the chart.

- Then we went to correlation country.
